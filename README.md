# finalproj_health_pred

Objective:
       The task is to predict the current health (as given by the target variable) of an organism given the measurements from two biological sensors measuring their bio-markers (negative indicates that it is lesser than the average case).With this data expected to try our linear regression cmodels on the training data and report the following metrics on the test split: (a) Mean Squared Error,Mean absolute error

STEPS FOLLOWED
      Downloaded the data set and detected outliers in the dataset
      
      Transformed the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps
      
      Created ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable in the target columnâ€™
      
      Created a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get predicted health measures

TECHNOLOGIES USED
      Python scripting,Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Data Preprocessing,EDA, Streamlit,pickle
